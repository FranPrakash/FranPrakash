ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fran!
Iâ€™m an iOS Engineer passionate about creating intuitive user experiences through code, design, and data.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m especially interested in iOS development, UX/UI design, and exploring how AI can enhance everyday apps.

âœ¨ Fun fact: I have an identical twin sister, and we were born on different days!

ðŸŽ§ Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me listening to podcasts, experimenting in the kitchen, watching shows, and spending quality time with family.

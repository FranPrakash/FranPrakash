👋 Hi, I’m @FranSantos
👀 I’m into UX/UI design, data analysis and software development
🌱 Currently diving into Java, SQL, and building cool projects!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things tech, design, and data
⚡ Fun fact: I have an identical twin sister, and we were born on different days!
🎧 I love listening to podcasts, cooking up something delicious, and learning about the universe—especially black holes!
